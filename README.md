**📌Project Overview**

This project focuses on enhancing the quality of images converted from PDF certificates.
A Microsoft certificate was initially downloaded as a PDF and converted into an image format. During this conversion, the image clarity and resolution were reduced. Instead of relying on online image enhancement tools, this project explores enhancing image quality directly using Python.

**🎯Objective**

Improve the clarity and resolution of certificate images

Avoid dependency on third-party online tools

Learn and apply image processing techniques using Python libraries

**🛠️Technologies Used**

Python

OpenCV

Pillow (PIL)

**⚙️Approach**

Convert the certificate PDF into an image

Load the image using Pillow and OpenCV

Apply image enhancement techniques such as:

Resizing

Sharpening

Quality improvement

Save the enhanced image with better clarity and size

**📚 Learning Outcome**

This project helped in understanding:

Basics of image processing

Practical use of OpenCV and Pillow

Automating real-world tasks using Python
